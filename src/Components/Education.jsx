          I recently completed my Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA),
          where I built a strong foundation in programming and web technologies.
          Currently, I have enrolled in an MCA program in online mode to further
          enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest trends in full
          stack development. My goal is to apply this knowledge to real-world
          projects and grow as a professional in the IT industry.

            I have successfully completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications
            (BCA), which provided me with a strong foundation in computer
            science and programming. Throughout the course, I gained hands-on
            experience in various technologies such as web development, database
            management, data structures, and object-oriented programming. This
            academic journey not only enhanced my technical skills but also
            improved my problem-solving abilities and logical thinking. My BCA
            degree has played a crucial role in shaping my interest in full
            stack development and prepared me for advanced studies and
            real-world software development challenges.
